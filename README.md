# Iris_Data_Analysis

## Project Overview:

This repository contains the code and documentation for our Iris Flowers data analysis project. We aim to explore, visualize, and model the Iris dataset to gain insights into these beautiful flowers.

## Dataset:

We use the famous Iris dataset, a commonly used dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Analysis Steps:

We have divided our analysis into several key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values (if any), and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand its distribution and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to enhance model performance.
Model Building: Developing machine learning models for classification.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the models' performance through various metrics.
Conclusion: Summarizing our findings and insights from the analysis.

## Code Files:

The data_analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contains the main analysis code, while the data directory includes the dataset.

## Dependencies:

We have used Python for this project and have listed all the required packages in the requirements.txt file. You can set up a virtual environment using these dependencies for replication.
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Collaboratory
